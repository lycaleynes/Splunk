<h1>Splunk</h1>

<p>This repository contains a collection of projects I developed for analyzing various types of logs using Splunk SIEM. Each project is designed to provide a structured, hands-on approach to uploading sample log files, performing in-depth analysis, and extracting actionable insights from specific types of log data.</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>

1. DNS Log Analysis with Splunk SIEM: In this project, I created a step-by-step process for analyzing DNS (Domain Name System) logs. It walks users through uploading sample files, extracting key fields, analyzing DNS query patterns, detecting anomalies, and monitoring DNS traffic.
2. FTP Log Analysis with Splunk SIEM: This project focuses on analyzing FTP (File Transfer Protocol) logs. I designed it to guide users through uploading sample logs, extracting relevant fields, analyzing FTP activity patterns, detecting unusual behavior, and monitoring FTP traffic.
3. HTTP Log Analysis with Splunk SIEM: I developed this project to help users analyze HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) logs effectively. It includes instructions for uploading logs, extracting important fields, identifying HTTP request patterns, detecting anomalies, and monitoring web traffic.
4. SSH Log Analysis with Splunk SIEM: This project provides a comprehensive guide I designed for analyzing SSH (Secure Shell) logs. It includes steps for uploading sample files, extracting fields, investigating SSH activity patterns, detecting anomalies, and correlating SSH logs with other data sources.
5. Tunnel Log Analysis with Splunk SIEM: I created this project to demonstrate how to analyze tunnel log traffic (e.g., GRE, IPv4, IPv6) from Zeek IDS. It covers uploading sample logs, conducting advanced analysis, detecting anomalies, and correlating tunnel data with other logs for enhanced threat detection.
6. SMTP Log Analysis with Splunk SIEM: This project reflects my structured approach to analyzing SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) logs. It includes steps for uploading sample log files, extracting key fields, analyzing email traffic patterns, identifying anomalies, and monitoring SMTP activity.
7. DHCP Log Analysis with Splunk SIEM: I designed this project to guide users in analyzing DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) logs. It covers uploading logs, extracting data fields, investigating IP address assignments, detecting unusual activity, and monitoring DHCP traffic.
