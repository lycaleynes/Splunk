<h1>Splunk</h1>

<p>This repository contains a collection of projects I developed for analyzing various types of logs using Splunk SIEM. Each project is designed to provide a structured, hands-on approach to uploading sample log files, performing in-depth analysis, and extracting actionable insights from specific types of log data.</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>

1. [DNS Log Analysis with Splunk SIEM](https://github.com/lycaleynes/Splunk/blob/04ed6eb99bcadd8832f2f0a7cd1b73b78f537c02/2%20-%20Analyzing%20DNS%20Log%20Files%20Using%20Splunk%20SIEM.md): In this project, I created a step-by-step process for analyzing DNS (Domain Name System) logs. It walks users through uploading sample files, extracting key fields, analyzing DNS query patterns, detecting anomalies, and monitoring DNS traffic.
2. HTTP Log Analysis with Splunk SIEM: I developed this project to help users analyze HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) logs effectively. It includes instructions for uploading logs, extracting important fields, identifying HTTP request patterns, detecting anomalies, and monitoring web traffic.
